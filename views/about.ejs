        <h2> Countries With Illiterate Citizens</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Illiteracy is defined as not knowing how to read or write beyond a basic level, understanding directions, or having the capacity to complete tasks in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>A person can either be purely or functionally illiterate. Purely illiterate individuals cannot read or write in any capacity for all practical purposes. In contrast, functionally illiterate individuals can read and potentially write simple sentences with a limited vocabulary, but cannot read or write well enough to handle the daily requirements of life in their own society.</p>

        <h2>Effects Of Poor Education On Kids</h2>
        <p>It’s estimated that over 90% of children out of school live in poverty.</p>
        <p>As you can see, poverty is hunger. It’s about not having money, a job, or a shelter. It’s about being sick without treatment. This has people living one day at a time, but with little hope for the future.</p>
        <p>According to the World Bank Organization, the primary cause of this is a lack of access to schools and the inability to read.</p><img src="flags/africankids.jpg" height="200" width="200">
